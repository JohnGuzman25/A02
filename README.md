## Part 2: Glossary of Git and GitHub Terms

- **Branch**: A branch in Git is an independent line of development. It allows developers to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main project.
- **Clone**: Cloning creates a local copy of a remote Git repository on your machine.
- **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of changes in your repository. Each commit includes a message that describes what changes were made.
- **Fetch**: Fetching updates your local repository with changes from the remote repository, but it does not merge them.
- **GIT**: Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code. It enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same project.
- **GitHub**: GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git for version control and allows developers to collaborate on projects.
- **Merge**: Merging combines changes from one branch into another, usually the main branch.
- **Merge Conflict**: A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between branches during a merge.
- **Push**: Pushing sends your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
- **Pull**: Pulling fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into your local repository.
- **Remote**: A remote is a version of your repository hosted on a server, like GitHub.
- **Repository**: A repository is a project container that stores your project’s files, history, and branches.
